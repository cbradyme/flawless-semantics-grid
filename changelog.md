#release 1.1.1 — January 16, 2013

* quickly changed the method of hiding the gutter so that it is now on the left rather than the right (also now uses a negative margin)
* added mixin to show grid using gradients

#release 1.1.0 — January 16, 2013

* remove need for omega classes
* added rythym.less for vertical rythym
* removed the other examples - will add when I have the time to fix them
* grid now compatible with semantic.gs, though requires strict use of row, column, row, row mixins to ensure everything works
