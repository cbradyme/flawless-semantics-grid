#release 1.1.0 — January 16, 2013

* remove need for omega classes
* added rythym.less for vertical rythym
* added mixin to show grid using gradients
* removed the other examples - will add when I have the time to fix them
* grid now compatible with semantic.gs, though requires strict use of row, column, row, row mixins to ensure everything works
